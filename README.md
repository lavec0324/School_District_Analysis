# School_District_Analysis - Module 4 Challenge

## Overview of Project

This project is intended to analyze school data and student data for the district.  This involves data cleansing activtiies, removing data 
that is deemed questionable, then providing results before and after removing the questionable records.  This data will provide insight into 
the district to make decisions on such things as spending based on school sizes as well as performance.

Only three files are necessary for this analysis:

   * [PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb](https://github.com/lavec0324/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb) - Jupyter Notbook created for analysis
   * [schools_complete.csv](https://github.com/lavec0324/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/schools_complete.csv) - School data file
   * [students_complete.csv](https://github.com/lavec0324/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/students_complete.csv) - Student data file

All other files in the repo are working data only or images.

## Results
Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
